# Geofs-Multiliveries
 This is an multilivery addon created by Spice 9 dev for geofs. Right now this addon only supports liveries for our Boeing 737 Max 8 and airbus a320neo . Multiplayer is supported to this addon now thanks to Ariakim Taiyo but at the moment it doesn't seem to work on the a320neo. 
So in order to make this addon work you would have to copy the code and paste it on console (press ctrl+shift+i). For the liveries you have to scroll down till the bottom of the aircraft list. Here is the most important thing , for max 8 you need the tui livery for making it work and fore a320neo you need Iberia and for 787-10 you will need Etihad livery. The A319-100 has also been implemented, which only works on the Finnair livery.

If you still dont understand how to make it work, then watch this tutorial by Aerospace rules https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLFyEEJZKbQ
